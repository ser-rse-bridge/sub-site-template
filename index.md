From a reader's perspective, this site is part of the <https://ser-rse-bridge.github.io> website.  But, structurally, it is hosted in a separate repository. 
While we can build out everything we want in the main site, there may be occasions where it is useful to separate a portion of the site and host
it in a separate repository.

This site is a template that carries the styling of the main site down to the subsite to facilitate keeping things consistent.  Though of course someone has 
to keep them in sync.  See the `README.md` file in this repository for more details.
